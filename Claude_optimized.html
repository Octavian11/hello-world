        <h1>HASSAN TARIQ / DEVONSHIRE PARTNERS</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Investment Thesis & Strategy</div>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>WHO I AM</h2>
        <p>Hassan Tariq, independent sponsor and founder of Devonshire Partners. 15 years of buy-side operations at Verition Fund Management ($10B+ multi-manager), Lazard Asset Management, and Barclays. Columbia Executive MBA, Class of 2026.</p>
        <p>Former customer of the businesses I'm acquiring.</p>
        <p>I have personally run and supported the exact trading infrastructure and regulatory workflows these companies are paid to deliver. This isn't theoretical domain expertiseâ€”I've lived on both sides of this market.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>WHAT I'M BUILDING</h2>
        <p>An independent sponsor building the go-to platform for mission-critical trading infrastructure and regulatory operationsâ€”the teams trading firms call when they absolutely cannot go down and cannot be out of compliance.</p>
        <p>End goal: Multi-company platform within 3-5 years, not a single-deal search fund exit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>INVESTMENT MODEL</h2>
        <p>Self-funded independent sponsor (NOT traditional search fund):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deal-by-deal capital raising from a small group of experienced investors</li>
            <li>No committed fund; investors review each acquisition opportunity</li>
            <li>Building LP bench now to transact immediately when the right platform becomes actionable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why self-funded: It gets to a multi-company platform faster than a traditional search fund, builds the right investor base from Day 1, and preserves full strategic control at the platform level.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>INVESTMENT FOCUS</h2>
        <p>Mission-Critical Trading Infrastructure & Regulatory Operations serving asset managers and broker-dealers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Managed trading infrastructure and connectivity:</strong> OMS/EMS support, FIX onboarding, production support, incident response</li>
            <li><strong>Market data operations and entitlements management:</strong> Licensing, vendor compliance, usage audits</li>
            <li><strong>Trade surveillance and regulatory evidence operations:</strong> Alert triage, best-ex reporting support, audit trail packaging</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>These functions are painful to staff in-house, high-stakes if they fail, and already partially outsourced today to founder-run specialists.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Target Profile:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>$1-5M EBITDA, founder-owned</li>
            <li>70%+ recurring revenue that is SLA-backed, retainer-based, or regulatory/process obligationâ€”not project-based consulting</li>
            <li>Mission-critical: downtime means trading desk goes dark</li>
            <li>Regulatory-critical: failures mean fines or business disruption</li>
            <li>Strong existing vendor / data / exchange relationships that can scale across clients</li>
            <li>Fragmented niche with visible bolt-on pipeline</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Target Universe:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We've identified 200+ named founder-owned firms across these categories</li>
            <li>30-50 match our EBITDA and recurring-revenue profile as viable platforms or bolt-ons</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE</h2>
        <p>Repeatable acquisition and value creation mechanics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Source founder-run firms in critical trading infrastructure and regulatory ops where the work is already partially outsourced</li>
            <li>Acquire control, give founder liquidity, keep them aligned through transition</li>
            <li>Professionalize contract structure, response discipline, renewal motion, reportingâ€”make the business institutionally ownable</li>
            <li>Consolidate by adding bolt-on specialists serving the same buyer and adjacent pain pointsâ€”so the platform becomes the obvious first call in that niche</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>The moat:</strong> We acquire companies that sit in the "you cannot be down and you cannot be out of compliance" layer. This creates pricing power, revenue stickiness, and multiple expansion at exit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>DIFFERENTIATION</h2>
        <p>There are searchers in HVAC and dental. There are PE funds at $20M EBITDA and up. There are lifestyle tech consultants. There are almost no sponsor-backed roll-ups led by someone who has personally run this exact trading infrastructure at multi-billion-dollar scale. That's the gap I'm filling.</p>
        
        <p><strong>vs. Generic Search Funders:</strong> 15 years institutional operations (not 2-5 years consulting). Domain expertise as former customer. Specialist positioning, not generalist.</p>
        
        <p><strong>vs. Industry Veterans:</strong> MBA + institutional discipline + independent sponsor backing. Building platform, not lifestyle business.</p>
        
        <p><strong>vs. Private Equity:</strong> Traditional PE wants $10M+ EBITDA on Day 1. I start smallerâ€”$1-5M EBITDAâ€”and build that first business into a platform that becomes the PE-scale asset. That gap between "too small for PE" and "too critical to ignore" is my strike zone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>CAPITAL STRATEGY</h2>
        <p><strong>LP Base:</strong> Deal-by-deal investors (not blind pool fund). Target 5-7 committed relationships willing to review opportunities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Deal Structure:</strong> Typical $1-5M EBITDA founder-led businesses with sticky, must-have services. Transactions will be structured with a mix of senior debt and investor equity appropriate to the assetâ€”SBA where it fits, conventional where scale or IP requires it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Financing Approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>SBA 7(a): $5M max at Prime + 2.75%, 10-year term (for eligible deals â‰¤$10M EV)</li>
            <li>Cash-Flow Term Lenders: 3.0-4.0x EBITDA at SOFR + 6-8% (Star Mountain, Twin Brook, Monroe Capital, NXT Capital, White Oak)</li>
            <li>Typical leverage: 60% senior debt, 15% seller note, 25% equity</li>
            <li>Faster close (45-60 days term debt vs 90-120 SBA)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Returns Target:</strong> 3-5x MOIC per deal over typical 5-7 year hold periods (22-35% IRR) through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operational improvements (margin expansion, professionalized delivery)</li>
            <li>Bolt-on acquisitions (platform consolidation in same niche)</li>
            <li>Multiple expansion (fragmented â†’ consolidated = higher exit multiple)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Platform with multiple simultaneous holdings achieved within 3-5 years.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>UNDERWRITING GUARDRAILS</h2>

        </ul>

        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Margins:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gross margin â‰¥45%, EBITDA â‰¥25% after market-rate CEO comp</li>
            <li>Delivery team utilization â‰¥75%</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Cash Conversion:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>DSO â‰¤60 days, AR >90 days <15%</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Deal Structure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No PE/VC ownership (any percentage = automatic pass)</li>
            <li>Vendor partnerships transferable or replaceable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>RED FLAGS (Automatic Pass):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-transferable vendor partnership + >60% revenue dependency</li>
            <li>Revenue declining >15% YoY for 2+ years</li>
            <li>Gross margin declining >500 bps over 2 years</li>
            <li>Chronic negative operating cash flow</li>
            <li>Major client churn (>20% revenue) in last 12 months</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>POSITIONING</h2>
        <p>Transparent about stage: "I'm building an independent sponsor platform from my first acquisition. Devonshire Partners is the investment vehicle."</p>
        
        <p>Language discipline: Use "I" for personal background/credibility. Use "Devonshire Partners" for investment entity/thesis/strategy.</p>
        
        <p>No pretense: Clear I'm first-time independent sponsor. Credibility comes from 15 years domain expertise, not fake track record.</p>
        
        <p>This is what I'm building. Feedback welcome.</p>
