## 1. STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### Who I Am

Hassan Tariq, independent sponsor and founder of Devonshire Partners. 15 years of buy-side operations at Verition Fund Management ($10B+ multi-manager), Lazard Asset Management, and Barclays. Columbia Executive MBA, Class of 2026. Former customer of the businesses I'm acquiring.

I have personally run and supported the exact trading infrastructure and regulatory workflows these companies are paid to deliver. This isn't theoretical domain expertise—I've lived on both sides of this market.

### What I'm Building

An independent sponsor building the go-to platform for mission-critical trading infrastructure and regulatory operations—the partner trading firms call when they absolutely cannot go down and cannot be out of compliance.

**End goal: Multi-company platform within 3-5 years**, not a single-deal search fund exit.

**Strategic inspiration drawn from:**
- RTC Partners: Independent sponsor model, platform building from Deal #1
- ZBS Partners: Sector-focused roll-up strategy in niche verticals
- Thoma Bravo: Software buy-and-build with operational value creation
- Constellation Software: Decentralized platform of vertical market software businesses

### Internal Positioning Discipline

**HOW TO TALK ABOUT THIS:**

**With Investors:**
- "I'm building an independent sponsor platform from my first acquisition. Devonshire Partners is the investment vehicle."
- Transparent about being first-time independent sponsor
- Credibility comes from 15 years domain expertise, not fake track record

**Language Discipline:**
- Use "I" for personal background/credibility
- Use "Devonshire Partners" for investment entity/thesis/strategy
- Never pretend to have closed deals I haven't closed
- Never use "we" when referring to team that doesn't exist yet

**With Founders:**
- Lead with operational expertise: "I ran these exact systems at Verition"
- Position as operator-buyer, not financial buyer
- Emphasize continuity, team retention, professionalization

**With Brokers:**
- "Independent sponsor focused on mission-critical trading infrastructure"
- "$1-5M EBITDA, founder-owned, 70%+ recurring"
- Responsive, decision-maker, can move quickly

## 2. INVESTMENT THESIS

### Investment Model

**Self-funded independent sponsor** (NOT traditional search fund):
- Deal-by-deal capital raising from small group of experienced investors
- No committed fund; investors review each acquisition opportunity
- Building LP bench now to transact immediately when right platform becomes actionable

**Why self-funded vs. traditional search fund:**
- Gets to multi-company platform faster (3-5 years vs 7-10 years)
- Builds right investor base from Day 1
- Preserves full strategic control at platform level
- No vesting schedules or performance hurdles limiting flexibility
- LP relationships continuous from Deal #1 forward

### Investment Focus

**Mission-Critical Trading Infrastructure & Regulatory Operations** serving asset managers and broker-dealers:

**Category 1: Managed Trading Infrastructure and Connectivity**
- OMS/EMS support, FIX onboarding, production support, incident response
- My Edge: 15 years operating these exact systems at $10B+ AUM institutions

**Category 2: Market Data Operations and Entitlements Management**
- Licensing, vendor compliance, usage audits
- My Edge: Built infrastructure supporting institutional data needs

**Category 3: Trade Surveillance and Regulatory Evidence Operations**
- Alert triage, best-ex reporting support, audit trail packaging
- My Edge: Understand regulatory requirements from institutional compliance side

**These functions are painful to staff in-house, high-stakes if they fail, and already partially outsourced today to founder-run specialists.**

### Target Profile

**Core Investment Criteria:**
- Revenue: $3-15M annually
- EBITDA: $1-5M (after market-rate CEO compensation)
- EBITDA Margin: 25%+ preferred
- Revenue Type: 70%+ recurring (SLA-backed, retainer-based, or regulatory/process obligation)
- Geography: United States
- Ownership: Founder-owned (NOT PE-backed)
- Customer Base: B2B institutional clients (asset managers, broker-dealers)
- Team: 10-100 employees

**Mission-critical characteristics:**
- Downtime means trading desk goes dark
- Regulatory-critical: failures mean fines or business disruption
- Strong existing vendor/data/exchange relationships that scale across clients
- Fragmented niche with visible bolt-on pipeline

### Target Universe

**Current Status:**
- 200+ named founder-owned firms identified across three categories
- 30-50 match EBITDA and recurring-revenue profile as viable platforms or bolt-ons
- Active database building with goal of 300+ qualified targets by Sprint 9 (mid-2026)

**Deal Flow Sources:**
- Proprietary outreach: 30% (direct to 200+ database)
- Broker relationships: 40% (15-17 active brokers)
- Industry network: 20% (Verition/Lazard/Barclays/Columbia)
- Platforms & events: 10% (Searchfunder, Axial, TradeTech conferences)

### Value Creation Playbook

**Repeatable acquisition and value creation mechanics:**

1. **Source** founder-run firms in critical trading infrastructure where work already partially outsourced
2. **Acquire** control, give founder liquidity, keep them aligned through transition
3. **Professionalize** contract structure, response discipline, renewal motion, reporting—make business institutionally ownable
4. **Consolidate** by adding bolt-on specialists serving same buyer—platform becomes obvious first call in niche

**The moat:** We acquire companies in "cannot be down/cannot be non-compliant" layer. This creates pricing power, revenue stickiness, multiple expansion at exit.

### Platform Cross-Sell Strategy

OMS/EMS SUPPORT → MARKET DATA SERVICES → TRADE SURVEILLANCE

**Logic:** Once we own OMS/EMS support firm, cross-sell market data normalization to same client base. From there, surveillance rule-tuning becomes natural add-on. Each acquisition expands wallet share with existing clients while providing bolt-on synergies.

**Example:** Platform company serves 50 asset managers with OMS implementation. Acquire market data management firm with 30 clients. Combined entity has 80 total clients with immediate cross-sell opportunities. Shared sales team, unified client success function, operational playbooks drive margin expansion.

### Underwriting Guardrails (GO/NO-GO Framework)

**Revenue Quality:**
- GRR (Gross Revenue Retention) ≥90%
- NRR (Net Revenue Retention) ≥100% (services: ≥95% acceptable)
- Recurring revenue ≥70% OR clear 12-18 month path to reach it

**Client Concentration:**
- Top 1 client ≤20% of revenue
- Top 5 clients ≤50% of revenue

**Margin Structure:**
- Services gross margin ≥45% (≥50% ideal)
- Delivery team utilization ≥75%
- EBITDA ≥25% after market-rate CEO compensation

**Cash Conversion:**
- DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) ≤60 days
- AR >90 days old <15% of total AR

**Deal Structure:**
- No PE/VC ownership (any percentage = automatic pass)
- Critical vendor partnerships transferable or replaceable
- Financeable with available capital stack

**RED FLAGS (Automatic Pass):**
- Non-transferable vendor partnership + >60% revenue dependency
- Declining revenue >15% YoY for 2+ consecutive years
- Gross margin declining >500 bps over 2 years with no explanation
- Chronic negative operating cash flow (2+ of last 3 years)
- Major client (>20% revenue) churned in last 12 months

### Capital Strategy

**LP Base:** Deal-by-deal investors (not blind pool fund). Target 5-7 committed relationships willing to review opportunities.

**Deal Structure:** Typical $1-5M EBITDA founder-led businesses. Mix of senior debt and investor equity appropriate to asset—SBA where it fits, conventional where scale or IP requires it.

**Financing Options:**
- **SBA 7(a):** $5M max at Prime + 2.75%, 10-year term (for eligible deals ≤$10M EV)
- **Cash-Flow Term Lenders:** 3.0-4.0x EBITDA at SOFR + 6-8%
  - Target lenders: Star Mountain Capital, Twin Brook, Monroe Capital, NXT Capital, White Oak
  - Typical leverage: 60% senior debt, 15% seller note, 25% equity
  - Faster close: 45-60 days (vs 90-120 for SBA)

**Returns Target:** 3-5x MOIC per deal over 5-7 year hold periods (22-35% IRR) through:
- Operational improvements (margin expansion, professionalized delivery)
- Bolt-on acquisitions (platform consolidation in same niche)
- Multiple expansion (fragmented → consolidated = higher exit multiple)

Platform with multiple simultaneous holdings achieved within 3-5 years.

## 3. DUAL-TRACK STRATEGY

### Track A: Income Generation ($20K/Month by January 2026)

**CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:** If income not secured by January 31, 2026, entire timeline extends by 3 months and strategy shifts to accept best available offer ≥$200K annually.

**Four-Lane Parallel Pursuit (50/40/10 Intensity Split):**

**Lane 1: Fractional COO (50% effort - Fastest Cash)**
- Target: 2 signed SOWs by end-January 2026
- Structure: 60-120 day engagements, outcome-based compensation ($8-12K/month per client)
- Time cap: Max 1 day/week per client (2 days/week total)
- Source: Ex-colleagues at Verition, Lazard, Barclays; CBS alumni at growth-stage companies

**Lane 2: Operating Partner / Portfolio Ops (40% effort - Brand + Deal Exposure)**
- Target: 1 finalist process by end-February 2026
- Must include 2 of 3: (a) Seat on value-creation/M&A committee, (b) Add-on integration mandate, (c) Partner invests in search funds/independent sponsors
- If role doesn't meet acceptance criteria: PASS even at $300K+ compensation
- Time cap: Up to 50% time IF comp ≥$25K/month AND meets criteria

**Lane 3: Interim COO (10% effort - Opportunistic)**
- Only accept if: Clear 100-day value creation mandate AND can ring-fence 4 hours/week for Track B
- Source: PE talent teams, InterimExecs, Bolster

**Lane 4: Platforms (10% effort - Feeder)**
- 2-3 high-fit bids/week on Bolster, Chief of Staff Network, Toptal
- Max 1-1.5 days/week total
- Treat as feeder for Fractional/OP opportunities, not primary income

**Red-Flag Triggers:**
- January 15: Zero signed SOWs → Deploy 10-call blitz to warm network
- January 31: <$15K/month income → Accept best Fractional/Interim offer immediately
- February 28: No OP finalist interviews → Shift 100% to Fractional
- Any time runway <4 months → Accept best available offer ≥$200K

### Track B: Independent Sponsor Development (Minimum Momentum Required)

**Even during peak income pursuit, MUST maintain:**

| Activity | Weekly Minimum | Why Critical |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Broker touches | 2 per week | Deal flow can't go cold for 3 months |
| Investor touches | 1 per week | LP relationships take 6-9 months to build |
| Database building | +5 targets/week | Need 200+ by Sprint 3 |
| LinkedIn post | 1 per week | Public momentum signal |
| Sunday review | 30 minutes | Five Questions + traffic light assessment |

**If too busy for these minimums, over-committed on Track A. Drop something immediately.**

**Two-Week Breach Trigger:** If exceed time caps for 2 consecutive weeks → drop one lane/client immediately.

## 5. DECISION FRAMEWORKS & RED LINES

2. **Network Activation:** Did I have 2+ meaningful conversations this week?
3. **Job Applications:** Did I apply to 4+ quality roles? (Track A lanes)
4. **Search Fund Momentum:** Am I building database? Broker engagement improving?
5. **Energy Level:** Am I energized or burnt out? (1-5 scale)

**Traffic Light Assessment:**
- GREEN: Hit 8+ primary KPIs, feel energized, family supportive
- YELLOW: Hit 5-7 KPIs, tired but not burnt out, family has concerns but on board
- RED: Hit <5 KPIs, exhausted, family stressed, activate contingencies

### Critical Checkpoints & Decision Points

**January 31, 2026 (Sprint 4):**
- Decision: Income secured at $20K/month?
- If NO: Accept best available offer ≥$200K OR extend timeline 3 months
- If YES: Continue dual-track with Track B accelerating

**May 2026 (Sprint 7):**
- Decision: Columbia graduation complete, 10+ LP relationships established?
- If NO: Reduce Track B intensity, focus more on LP building

### Runway Management & Red Lines

**Current Runway Status:**
- Monthly burn rate: [To be filled based on actual family expenses]
- Current runway: [To be calculated based on savings]
- Red line: 4 months remaining

**Red Line Triggers:**
- If runway drops below 4 months at ANY time: Accept best available offer ≥$200K immediately
- No exceptions, no "one more month" extensions
- Family security > search fund timeline

**Contingency Protocols:**
- Scenario 1: Income secured but deal flow weak → Expand to Tier 2 categories
- Scenario 2: Deal flow strong but income weak → Accept interim COO role
- Scenario 3: Both weak → Pause Track B, focus 100% on income
- Scenario 4: Runway breached → Accept any offer ≥$200K, preserve option to restart later
