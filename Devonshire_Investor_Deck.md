## WHO I AM

Hassan Tariq, independent sponsor and founder of Devonshire Partners. 15 years of buy-side operations at Verition Fund Management ($10B+ multi-manager), Lazard Asset Management, and Barclays. Columbia Executive MBA, Class of 2026. Former customer of the businesses I'm acquiring.

**I have personally run and supported the exact trading infrastructure and regulatory workflows these companies are paid to deliver.** This isn't theoretical domain expertise—I've lived on both sides of this market.

## WHAT I'M BUILDING

An independent sponsor building the go-to platform for mission-critical trading infrastructure and regulatory operations—the teams trading firms call when they absolutely cannot go down and cannot be out of compliance.

**End goal: Multi-company platform within 3-5 years**, not a single-deal search fund exit.

---

## INVESTMENT MODEL

**Self-funded independent sponsor** (NOT traditional search fund):
- Deal-by-deal capital raising from a small group of experienced investors
- No committed fund; investors review each acquisition opportunity
- Building LP bench now to transact immediately when the right platform becomes actionable

**Why self-funded:** It gets to a multi-company platform faster than a traditional search fund, builds the right investor base from Day 1, and preserves full strategic control at the platform level.

## INVESTMENT FOCUS

**Mission-Critical Trading Infrastructure & Regulatory Operations** serving asset managers and broker-dealers:

**Managed trading infrastructure and connectivity:**
- OMS/EMS support, FIX onboarding, production support, incident response

**Market data operations and entitlements management:**
- Licensing, vendor compliance, usage audits

**Trade surveillance and regulatory evidence operations:**
- Alert triage, best-ex reporting support, audit trail packaging

**These functions are painful to staff in-house, high-stakes if they fail, and already partially outsourced today to founder-run specialists.**

**Target Profile:**
- $1-5M EBITDA, founder-owned
- 70%+ recurring revenue that is SLA-backed, retainer-based, or regulatory/process obligation—not project-based consulting
- Mission-critical: downtime means trading desk goes dark
- Regulatory-critical: failures mean fines or business disruption
- Strong existing vendor / data / exchange relationships that can scale across clients
- Fragmented niche with visible bolt-on pipeline

**Target Universe:**
- We've identified 200+ named founder-owned firms across these categories
- 30-50 match our EBITDA and recurring-revenue profile as viable platforms or bolt-ons

## HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE

**Repeatable acquisition and value creation mechanics:**

1. **Source** founder-run firms in critical trading infrastructure and regulatory ops where the work is already partially outsourced
2. **Acquire** control, give founder liquidity, keep them aligned through transition
3. **Professionalize** contract structure, response discipline, renewal motion, reporting—make the business institutionally ownable
4. **Consolidate** by adding bolt-on specialists serving the same buyer and adjacent pain points—so the platform becomes the obvious first call in that niche

**The moat:** We acquire companies that sit in the "you cannot be down and you cannot be out of compliance" layer. This creates pricing power, revenue stickiness, and multiple expansion at exit.

## DIFFERENTIATION

There are searchers in HVAC and dental. There are PE funds at $20M EBITDA and up. There are lifestyle tech consultants. **There are almost no sponsor-backed roll-ups led by someone who has personally run this exact trading infrastructure at multi-billion-dollar scale.** That's the gap I'm filling.

**vs. Generic Search Funders:** 15 years institutional operations (not 2-5 years consulting). Domain expertise as former customer. Specialist positioning, not generalist.

**vs. Industry Veterans:** MBA + institutional discipline + independent sponsor backing. Building platform, not lifestyle business.

**vs. Private Equity:** Traditional PE wants $10M+ EBITDA on Day 1. I start smaller—$1-5M EBITDA—and build that first business into a platform that becomes the PE-scale asset. That gap between "too small for PE" and "too critical to ignore" is my strike zone.

---

## CAPITAL STRATEGY

**LP Base:** Deal-by-deal investors (not blind pool fund). Target 5-7 committed relationships willing to review opportunities.

**Deal Structure:** Typical $1-5M EBITDA founder-led businesses with sticky, must-have services. Transactions will be structured with a mix of senior debt and investor equity appropriate to the asset—SBA where it fits, conventional where scale or IP requires it.

**Financing Approach:**
- **SBA 7(a):** $5M max at Prime + 2.75%, 10-year term (for eligible deals ≤$10M EV)
- **Cash-Flow Term Lenders:** 3.0-4.0x EBITDA at SOFR + 6-8% (Star Mountain, Twin Brook, Monroe Capital, NXT Capital, White Oak)
- Typical leverage: 60% senior debt, 15% seller note, 25% equity
- Faster close (45-60 days term debt vs 90-120 SBA)

**Returns Target:** 3-5x MOIC per deal over typical 5-7 year hold periods (22-35% IRR) through:
- Operational improvements (margin expansion, professionalized delivery)
- Bolt-on acquisitions (platform consolidation in same niche)
- Multiple expansion (fragmented → consolidated = higher exit multiple)

Platform with multiple simultaneous holdings achieved within 3-5 years.
